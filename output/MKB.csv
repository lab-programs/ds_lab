life death see exam going appear exam studied whole year test life test kind life lived life living life aspire live must many occasions life besides examinations appeared inside classrooms notebooks encounter endure many tests trials thus success failure life determined one done examination burden must free us extremely inspiring example former president dr apj abdul kalam appeared test recruitment air force failed suppose failure caused become dejected concede defeat life would india found great scientist glorious president never one richa anand ji sent question “ today see biggest challenge facing education come focus solely examinations marks become important result competition multiplied leading high increase stress students also would like know views concerning current direction education future course ” although given answer query richa ji wishes must put forth views matter marks marksheet serve limited purpose life confined life truly means knowledge acquired life truly goes terms whether whatever learned tried live also life moves ahead depending upon condition whatever sense mission achieved whatever sense ambition nurture whether ongoing coordination sense mission sense ambition faith things marks automatically follow never chase marks knowledge going use life skill selfconfidence determination tell must family doctor members family must going whenever needed would single person family might asked family doctor many marks score passing exam none could raised question would thought doctor good finding relief treatment thus started taking services regularly fight big law suit go lawyer engage services look marksheet lawyer look experience knowledge graph success therefore burden hankering marks hinders us sometimes going right direction mean ’ implying ’ study studies definitely useful testing mettle know stood yesterday stand today also happens sometimes analyse minutely journey life realise start running marks look shortest ways identify selected things focus something comes outside things touched upon question comes outside bunch selected questions prepared find slipping rock bottom pursuit knowledge focal point try acquire attain lot however concentrate focus getting marks gradually go limiting confine certain areas earning marks thus may find despite becoming brilliant passing exams sometimes failed life richa ji also mentioned ‘ pratispardha ’ meaning competition others huge psychological battle reality competition others takes us ahead life competing ‘ anuspardha ’ takes life forward tomorrow made better yesterday future occasion used improve upon past results make instantly clear shall cite example field sports feature life successful players compete let us take example mr sachin tendulkar kept breaking records consecutively consistently twenty years everytime surpassing outdoing thus continuously forging ahead wonderful journey life followed route competing rather competing others friends every field life taking exams able study peacefully two hours earlier able three hours ’ wake decided time morning thus delayed get early time ’ sleep earlier due exam tension able sleep put test ’ find defeat competition others results frustration disappointment despair jealousy ‘ anuspardha ’ ‘ competition self ’ leads selfanalysis introspection makes determination stronger resolute prevail motivation better becomes innate ’ need external sources energy energy generated within put simple language would say compete someone else three broad possibilities arise first much better second much worse third equal better competitor become complacentas filled overconfidence perform poorly become distressed disappointed filled envy devour consume equal competitor never feel need improve life go pace therefore urge engage ‘ anuspardha ’ ‘ competition self ’ must focus improve upon past performance perform even better ’ witness positive change bring shriman sunder ji expressed feelings role parents says exams parents vital role play writes “ mother educated yet would sit ask solve problems mathematics would compare answers thus great help would help rectify errors mother clear class exam yet without aid would impossible pass cbse exam ” sunder ji say absolutely correct must observed today also women majority amongst ask questions send suggestions mothers consciously aware actively alert children ’ future play big role assuaging atmosphere home shall urge parents lay emphasis three points acceptance mentoring sharing time accept things whatever capabilities posses use mentor
